# Logic Challenges

- Complete the challenge listed for your team number.
- You do NOT need to write any form of code, simply explain the steps required in as much detail as you can.
- If you choose, you may pseudo-code (use common logical notation, like &&, ||, IF, ELSE, etc)

## Team 1
Given a 10 digit number (9876543210), what steps must be taken to format it as a standard US phone number (not including a country code)?
ie. (987)654-3210

## Team 2
Given a series of random letters, numbers, and/or symbols, what steps must be taken to reverse the series?
ie. abc123 -> 321cba

## Team 3
Given a series of random letters, numbers, and/or symbols, what steps must be taken to detect a sub set of characters?
ie. does AbCedTf contain edT

## Team 4
Given a series of random letters, numbers, and/or symbols, what steps must be taken to detects a palandrome (a sequence that is the same forwards and backwards)?
ie. is ABCdCBA a palandrome?

## Team 5
Given three numbers in a sequence, what steps must be taken to determine the fifth number in the sequence?
ie. 3, 6, 12 -> 48

## Team 6
Given a number of boolean (true/false) conditions, what steps must be taken to ensure that you have a result for any possible outcome?
ie. 1 condition requires 2 outcomes
*consider multiple numbers of conditions to test your logic*

## Team 7
Given two series of random letters, numbers, and/or symbols, what steps must be taken to detect if they are identical?
ie. zyxw is equivelent to zyxw
